<h1>Artist Statement</h1>
<p >Studying a foundation in Art and Design has given me a better insight into what path I want to follow in the future. I have always been interested in creating graphic designs using computer software, but I am now finding that using traditional means are just as enjoyable, if not more rewarding. In my work i draw inspiration from my past and present life experiences. I find this is a good way to express myself and my ideas. I often draw inspiration from the daily happenings of things around me, such as humorous conversations I hear throughout the day, interesting architecture and stories in the newspaper. I enjoy being creative and I view Art as a natural way for me to express myself. The foundation course allowed me to experiment with different media, and bring out more of my creative side. I was drawn to this course because it offered more freedom. Throughout my time here I have realized that I am also very fond of illustration. I am excited to try out new techniques and different ways in which I can illustrate and put across ideas. I have also had the chance to use traditional techniques while on the course rather than just using the computer. I have developed a new interest in photography, both digital and with film. In my spare time I enjoy reading horror novels and thrillers, these often give me inspiration for illustrations and design. I love visiting art galleries and exhibitions, after visiting the Tate Gallery in Liverpool, the Josh Kirby exhibition caught my attention in particular. He was the original Discworld illustrator and really brought Terry Pratchett's ideas to life. Studying Graphic Design and Illustration at university will develop my skills, help develop a more individual style of illustrating and designing, and also help to build a strong, individual portfolio leading to a successful career.
